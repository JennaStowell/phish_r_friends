# phish_r_friends

In Progress - Current problem is that Resend API has ethical restrictions on sending random emails (which is good, I understand). I have the code to send emails commented out for testing (because j.doe@comcast.net would've received A LOT of test emails), so I'm unsure how far to push to get this working... I would be hesitant to test it properly.

**Final Project:** A script where users can input names of their friends and attempt to send them a "phishing" email. The code uses their name and other info to guess that person's email address and send them a phishing email - except it's just a prank and not malicious. Train your friends *NOT* to simply click on any link!
